This document shows a minimal example of the template.
For more information, see the [full demo](https://kazuyanagimoto.com/quarto-academic-typst/template-full.pdf) and its [source](https://kazuyanagimoto.com/quarto-academic-typst/template-full.qmd).

# Section as Heading Level 1

Section numbering can be specified in the YAML `section-numbering` field
as other Typst templates.

## Subsection as Heading Level 2

You can use LaTeX math expressions:

$$
Y_{it} = \alpha_i + \lambda_t + \sum_{k \neq -1} \tau_h \{E_i + k = t\} +
\varepsilon_{it}.
$$

### Subsubsection as Heading Level 3

I don't use and don't recommend using heading levels 3 and below but it works.

## Citation

You can cite a reference like this [@katsushika1831] or @horst2020.
Typst has some built-in citation styles. Check the [Typst documentation](https://typst.app/docs/reference/model/bibliography/#parameters-style) for more information.

# Figures and Tables

## Figures

As @fig-hist-mpg shows, the caption is displayed below the figure.
As a caption of the figure (`fig-cap`), I use bold text for the title and use a normal text for the description.

```{r}
#| label: fig-hist-mpg
#| fig-cap: "**Histogram of Miles per Gallon**. The x-axis shows the miles per gallon, and the y-axis shows the frequency."

hist(mtcars$mpg)
```

## Tables

You can use [tinytable](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/tinytable/)
for general tables and [modelsummary](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/modelsummary/) for regression tables.^[Since the default backend of `modelsummary` is `tinytable`, you can use the customization options of `tinytable` for `modelsummary`.]
As @tbl-mtcars-head shows, the caption is displayed above the table.
The notes of the table can be added using the `notes` argument of the `tinytable::tt()` function.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-mtcars-head
#| tbl-cap: Head of the mtcars Dataset

nt <- "_Notes_: This table shows the first six rows of the mtcars dataset."
mtcars[1:5, 1:5] |>
  tinytable::tt(width = 0.8, notes = nt)         
```
# Last words

I made this template for my working papers, so it may not be suitable for other fields than economics.
I am happy to receive feedback and suggestions for improvement.

{{< appendix >}}

# Supplemental Figures

The figure numbering will be reset to "A.1", "A.2", etc so that it is clear that these figures are part of the appendix.

```{r}
#| label: fig-scatter-car
#| fig-cap: "**Scatter Plot of Car Data**. The x-axis shows the weight of the car, and the y-axis shows the miles per gallon."

plot(mtcars$wt, mtcars$mpg)
```
